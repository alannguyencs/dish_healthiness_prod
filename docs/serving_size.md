Each *standard measurement* below uses FDA metric equivalents (cup, tbsp, tsp, ounce), and each *hand measurement* is a practical visual estimate.

## Bread, cereal, rice, pasta

| Dish category | Standard measurement (FDA / USDA) | Hand / finger estimate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bread slice | 1 slice bread ≈ 1 serving (about 1 oz ≈ 28 g). | Size of your **flat palm** from base of fingers to mid‑finger, thickness of a normal slice. |
| Ready‑to‑eat cereal | 1 ounce cereal (28 g) = 1 serving; volume varies by cereal shape. | About **one cupped hand** of flakes or puffs. |
| Cooked cereal / rice / pasta | 1/2 cup cooked = 1 serving. 1/2 cup = 120 mL. | 1/2 cup ≈ **one cupped hand** (not tightly packed). |

## Vegetables

| Dish category | Standard measurement | Hand / finger estimate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw leafy vegetables | 1 cup raw leafy veg = 1 serving (240 mL). | ~ size of **one closed fist** piled loosely. |
| Other vegetables (cooked or chopped raw) | 1/2 cup = 1 serving (120 mL). | **One cupped hand** of pieces. |
| Vegetable juice | 3/4 cup = 1 serving (180 mL). | A bit less than a **full fist** of liquid in a small glass. |

## Fruit

| Dish category | Standard measurement | Hand / finger estimate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whole fruit | 1 medium apple/banana/orange = 1 serving (about 1 piece). | A fruit about the size of your **fist**. |
| Chopped / cooked / canned fruit | 1/2 cup = 1 serving (120 mL). | **One cupped hand** of fruit pieces. |
| Fruit juice | 3/4 cup = 1 serving (180 mL). | Juice filling a small glass about **three‑quarters of a fist** high. |

## Milk, yogurt, cheese

| Dish category | Standard measurement | Hand / finger estimate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Milk or yogurt | 1 cup = 1 serving (240 mL). | Liquid or spoonable food filling a mug roughly the size of your **fist**. |
| Natural cheese | 1½ oz = 1 serving; 1 oz = 28 g ⇒ 1½ oz ≈ 42 g. | About **two thumb‑sized** cubes of cheese. |
| Process cheese | 2 oz = 1 serving (≈ 56 g). | Roughly **three thumb‑sized** pieces or a slice stack the size of two thumbs side‑by‑side. |

## Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts

| Dish category | Standard measurement | Hand / finger estimate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lean meat, poultry, fish (per serving) | 2–3 oz cooked lean meat/poultry/fish = 1 serving. 1 oz = 28 g. | 2–3 oz ≈ **palm of your hand** (length and width, thickness of a deck of cards). |
| Daily meat‑group total | 5–7 oz cooked lean meat (or equivalent) per day. | About **2–3 palm‑sized** portions across the day. |
| Cooked dry beans | 1/2 cup beans = 1 oz meat equivalent. So 1½ cups beans ≈ 3 oz meat. | 1/2 cup ≈ **one cupped hand** of beans. |
| Egg | 1 egg = 1 oz meat equivalent. | One **whole egg** about the size of your palm center. |
| Peanut butter | 2 tbsp peanut butter = 1 oz meat equivalent. 1 tbsp = 15 mL. | 2 tbsp ≈ length and thickness of **your whole thumb** spread twice (two thumbfuls). |

## Quick reference for the measurement units

- 1 cup = 240 mL; 1 tablespoon = 15 mL; 1 teaspoon = 5 mL; 1 fluid ounce = 30 mL; 1 ounce (weight) = 28 g.
- Fist ≈ 1 cup; cupped hand ≈ 1/2 cup; palm (no fingers) ≈ 2–3 oz of meat; thumb ≈ 1 tbsp; thumb tip ≈ 1 tsp.
